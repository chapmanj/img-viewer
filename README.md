# img-viewer
a simple image viewer for images (including gifs)

## Motivation 🤓
Previously, I have been developing using C# in Microsoft Visual Studio 12. 
For many years I have had been dual booting Windows and Ubuntu (Linux).
I knew that with MonoDev I could develop C# applications for Linux.
The image viewer was a basic concept I initially created in Visual Studios and ported to Linux.

## Takeaways 📖
 - I develped a general understanding about generating application forms using gtk.
 - Though the .Net codebase is fully supported, linking up the gtk gui with it is a bit different (as can be expected).

## Future 👨‍💻
Possible additions:
  - Video support
